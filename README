*2 ships belonging to opposing teams. Ships on the same team do not collide with each other.
*Take manual control of a ship by selecting it and pressing 'm', can move it with WASD and fire bullets with space
*All ships can be selected by click or lasoo drag
*Ships can be given orders by right-clicking. On empty space to give move order, on a ship to make it follow
*1 draggable panel with a button that spawns more enemy ships.
*All ships have a sensor radius at which they are aware of other ships.
*Rudimentary AI in ships allows them to fire at hostile ships.
*Primitive turrets that attach to ships with joints. Visible, little else.
